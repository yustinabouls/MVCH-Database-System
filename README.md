# Mountain View Community Hospital Management System 🏥👩‍⚕️

Hello there! Welcome to the Mountain View Community Hospital Management System project. This system is a comprehensive database solution, developed with a focus on improving operational efficiency for medical services, staff, and patients in a not-for-profit, short-term general hospital.

## Features 🚀

- **Robust Data Management:** Leveraging the power of C# and SQL, we've constructed a system that allows for efficient data management and swift access. This translates to improved operations and seamless experiences for hospital staff and patients.

- **MVC Architecture:** Our application is structured around the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. This design enhances code maintainability and scalability, enabling the system to adapt and grow along with the hospital's needs.

- **Powerful Reporting:** We've developed a Report Viewer interface using C# and Crystal Reports. With this tool, the hospital can generate Room Utilization and Physician-Patient reports, thereby enhancing data analysis and decision-making processes.

- **Database Design Best Practices:** The system has been constructed with careful attention to database design and normalization. This rigorous approach ensures accurate data representation and efficient retrieval, bolstering the reliability and speed of the system.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** With the end-user in mind, the system is designed to be easy to navigate and intuitive to use. This user-centric approach makes it a breeze for hospital staff to manage daily operations effectively.
